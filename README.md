Project Title:
“COVID-19 Impact Analysis: Trends, Patterns & Insights”**


Short Description

This project explores the spread and impact of COVID-19 across the world using real-world data. The analysis focuses on infection trends, death rates, recovery patterns, and regional comparisons — with a special focus on Kenya. Visualizations and insights are drawn from global datasets to better understand how the pandemic evolved over time.

Objectives of the Project:

* To analyze the global trend of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
* To identify the countries with the highest and lowest impact.
* To compare Kenya’s COVID-19 data with global averages.
* To explore how case numbers changed over time (e.g., peaks, drops).
* To visualize the data using charts and graphs for better understanding.
* To generate insights and reflect on the implications of the data.

Tools and Libraries Used:

* Python 3.11
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas – For data manipulation
* NumPy – For numerical operations
* Matplotlib – For basic visualizations
* Seaborn – For advanced visualizations
* Plotly - interactive graphs

* Example: "Global cases peaked in \[Month, Year] with \[X million] cases reported."
* Example: "Kenya’s cases rose sharply after \[event], showing a \[X]% increase."
* Example: "Europe had higher deaths per capita, possibly due to \[reason]."
* Example: "Countries that imposed lockdowns early had flatter curves."
